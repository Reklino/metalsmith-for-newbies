MetalSmith is a static site generator powered by node.js. Javascript's hot right now. Static Site Gens are hot right now. Therefore:

MetalSmith... So hot right now.

On top of being on the cutting edge of tech, it's actually got a lot of really great plugins. If you've used a build tool like Gulp or Grunt before, chances are you'll pick up MetalSmith fairly quickly. The difference between something like Gulp and a Static Site Gen like MetalSmith is, well, **not much**. MetalSmith just specializes in compiling, structuring, and building content. To prove my point, here's [a great article](https://medium.com/objects-in-space/considering-a-static-site-tool-learn-gulp-2fd5f9821fc4#.ou4bohmks) by Andrew Colclough on using **Gulp** as a static site generator.

If you're new to build tools, there's no better time to learn than with a static site generator. Most static site generators (including MetalSmith) actually provide a lot of the same functionality through plugins as Gulp or Grunt.
