				<p>MetalSmith is a static site generator powered by node.js. Javascript&#39;s hot
					right now. Static Site Gens are hot right now. Therefore:</p>

				<p>MetalSmith... So hot right now.</p>
				<p>On top of being on the cutting edge of tech, it&#39;s actually got a lot of really
					great plugins. If you&#39;ve used a build tool like Gulp or Grunt before, chances
					are you&#39;ll pick up MetalSmith fairly quickly. The difference between something
					like Gulp and a Static Site Gen like MetalSmith is, well, <strong>not much</strong>.
					MetalSmith just specializes in compiling, structuring, and building content.
					To prove my point, here&#39;s <a href="https://medium.com/objects-in-space/considering-a-static-site-tool-learn-gulp-2fd5f9821fc4#.ou4bohmks">a great article</a>					by Andrew Colclough on using <strong>Gulp</strong> as a static site generator.</p>
				<p>If you&#39;re new to build tools, there&#39;s no better time to learn than with
					a static site generator. Most static site generators (including MetalSmith)
					actually provide a lot of the same functionality through plugins as Gulp or
					Grunt.</p>
